.. a very good place to start.

Let's start with this <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> page. In addition to its <a href="https://guides.github.com/">Git repository hosting service</a>, it can also host a web page as a <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub page</a>. It seems to be a common tool for people sharing their code, and seems both convenient and powerful.
