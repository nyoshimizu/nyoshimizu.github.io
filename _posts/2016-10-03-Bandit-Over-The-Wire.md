Capture the flag events are competitions where participants face off to compete
in different domains of computer securrity, such as finding and exploiting
vulnerabilities. In contrast, a wargame allows you to try the same tasks on
a dedicated, ongoing server. I suppose the latter is analogous to playing
against an NPC.
<!--end excerpt-->

Over the last week or so, I completed the 
<a href="http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/">Bandit wargame</a> set up
by OverTheWire. It's the first in their recommended, 
<a href="http://overthewire.org/wargames/">ordered list</a> of their
wargames.  The Bandit level is meant to be the most basic introduction.

I think it's an introduction especially for those unfamiliar with using
Linux. It'll bring you up to speed in using some specific tools in Linux
as well as teach you to do that for yourself. It involves mostly
local-level things and a few levels which require tasks over the network
(i.e. nc and ssh). There are a couple at the end that require "hacking,"
but they're otherwise directed tasks. I think what you get out of it will 
depend on your background, though if it's too basic you will simply breeze
through it anyway (no menial tasks here).

There's one challenge I want to go back to optimize (and will teach me
something important about how something in Linux works) and a command
I want to look at because it caused a segmentation fault, but I think
I will move on to the other levels. This is the SHA1 hash of the 
conatenation of the password for level 26 of Bandit and nyoshimizu 
(in that order): 2ac69396fc273902987a7f695e2f839158ea543a.
