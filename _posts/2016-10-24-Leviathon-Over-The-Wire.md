I completed the <a href="http://overthewire.org/wargames/leviathan/">Leviathon</a>
challenges on Over The Wire. 
<!--end excerpt-->

Fun, short set of challenges. New tools for me: ltrace (a library call tracer),
ln (make links between files), and a little bit of BASH scripting. 

Final message:

Well Done, you seem to have used a *nix system before, now try something more serious.
(Please don't post writeups, solutions or spoilers about the games on the web. Thank you!)
