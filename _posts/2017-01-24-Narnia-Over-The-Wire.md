I completed the <a href="http://overthewire.org/wargames/Narnia/">Narnia</a>
challenges on Over The Wire. 
<!--end excerpt-->

These challenges relied on combinations of buffer overflow, shell code,
gdb, some assembly, and return to libc among other things. 

Final message:

FINISHED. CONGRATULATIONS file reads:

(Please don't post writeups, solutions or spoilers about the games on the web. Thank you!)
