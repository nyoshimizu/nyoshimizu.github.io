Microcorruption is a embedded security CTF. I've completed up to Chernobyl, which is 17 levels in, plus the tutorial. 
<!--end excerpt-->

This is an embedded systems CTF, emulating TI's MSP430. It was really, really fun. It's generally low level, assembly stuff.

I started this CTF 5/24/2016 and finished up to Lagos (the sixteenth level) on 6/23/2016. Not having worked on it for a while, I wrapped up with Chernobyl on 3/7/2017. I think this is a good stopping point for me.. this one took awhile and having looked a bit at the next level (Hollywood), I think it's too time consuming for now.
