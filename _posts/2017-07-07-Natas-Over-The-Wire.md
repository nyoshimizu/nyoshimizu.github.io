I completed the <a href="http://overthewire.org/wargames/Natas/">Natas</a>
challenges on Over The Wire. 
<!--end excerpt-->

Natas is a web pentest-type challenge, but covering lots of topics such as blind SQL injection, user authentication, defeating input validation, Perl, etc. There were many levels (topping off at thirty-three).

Final message:

Congratulations! You have reached the endâ€¦ for now.
