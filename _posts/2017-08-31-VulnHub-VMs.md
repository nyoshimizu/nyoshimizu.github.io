I completed a handful of VMs from [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com), specifically trying to follow Abatchy's [list](http://www.abatchy.com/2017/02/oscp-like-vulnhub-vms.html) of suggest VMs for OSCP. 
<!--end excerpt-->

Some VMs on the list were not attemped beacuse I had toruble getting it to run either on VirtualBox or VM Workstastion. These were rooted from around May to August 2017, listed below, which is quite a while ago but are being listed for reference.

- Mr Robot
- Kioptrix 2
- Kioptrix 3
- Kioptrix 4
- Fristileaks
- pwnlab_init (shell but no root?)
- Brainpan
- SickOSv1.1
- SickOSv1.2
- Vulnix
- VulnOSv2
- SkyTower
- Stapler
- IMF (shell but no root)

Over all, it's been a good intro to web pentesting, getting more exposure to different tools and methods, and being able to carry out a exploitation in full.
