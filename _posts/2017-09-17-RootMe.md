From 9/1/2017 to 9/17/2017, spent a couple weeks working on challenges at [RootMe](https://www.root-me.org). 

<!--end excerpt-->

I worked on challenges across their Realist, Web-server, App-Script, and Network sections. It was an interesting  mix of topics such as pentesting, privilege escalation, cryptography, Bash, and escaping limited shells in Python.

The website lists the number of people who successful completed the challenges, so I tried to attack some low  number one as well.. typically the easier challenges start in the thousands or tens of thousands and the less popular ones go as low as a hundred or less.

It looks like I've completed 52 challenges total so far. I really had fun with the Restricted Shells, which was basically privilege escalation on a Linux box. This seems like a newer resource, so this is definitely something worth coming back to.
