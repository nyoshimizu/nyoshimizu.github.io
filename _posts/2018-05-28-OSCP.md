Completed OSCP.

<!--end excerpt-->

Busy first quarter of 2018 at work, but finally found time to pass OSCP. They send you a very nice folder containing a certificate and a card. 

I tracked my time using [Timetracker](http://0xff.net/site/index.php/timetracker/info/). It looks like I spent a few hours reviewing the materials, about 60 hours doing the exercises, and 190 hours working in the labs. I also did further reviews afterwards, did some more pentesting at [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu), and attacked (and reattacked) some machines from VulnHub. I wrote up quite a few notes preparing for the exam, which I should maybe reorganize, clean up, and put here for reference.
